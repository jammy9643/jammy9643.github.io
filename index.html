    <p class = "italize">One of my interest is rock climbing. It's a great workout that exercises your whole body, be prepared to be sore when you wake up the next day! There are many indoor rock climbing facilities that started popping up in and around Chicago in the last few years, it's a new workout trend that's becoming popular, so you should try it out, too!</p>
